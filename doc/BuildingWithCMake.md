# Building with CMake

Development is underway for a new build system using CMake. At this point, the CMake build system is **incomplete and
experimental**.

Normal build instructions are in the main [`README.md`](../README.md).

## Requirements

* `cmake` 3.2 or newer;
* A supported C++ toolchain, E.G. `clang`, `gcc`, or `msvc`;
* A supported build tool, E.G. `ninja`, `make`, or Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Alright, lets do this

```bash
# always prefer building outside the source tree
mkdir -p build && cd build
# configure the build
cmake .. # point cmake at the root source directory
# build it
cmake --build .
```

## Configuring the build

CMake build variables can be set on the command line with `cmake -D<flag>[=<value>]`. Variables are cached in
`CMakeCache.txt`. You can list cached variables with `cmake -L`. There is also a helpful tool, `cmake-gui`, which may
make your life easier.

CMake can generate build files for a number of backends. You can select the generator with `-G<generator>`, and list
available generators with `--help`. We recommend using with the `Ninja` generator, when available. More information is
available [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

### Major feature flags

Compilation of major components is controlled with the following On/Off flags:
* `OMR_COMPILER`: **Not yet supported**.
* `OMR_GC`: Requires `OMR_PORT` and `OMR_THREAD`. Default is `ON`.
* `OMR_JITBUILDER`: **Not yet supported**.
* `OMR_PORT`: Default is `ON`.
* `OMR_THREAD`: Default is `ON`.

Additionally, most testing can be enabled with the `OMR_FVTEST` flag.
For more information on testing, see below.

### The glue libraries

With the move to CMake the glue as been separated out into a number of components, specified by the following variables:
* `OMR_GC_GLUE_TARGET`
* `OMR_UTIL_GLUE_TARGET`
* `OMR_RAS_GLUE_TARGET`
* `OMR_CORE_GLUE_TARGET`

Each variable should specify the name of an interface library, which will be linked into the corresponding OMR library.
Eg. `OMR_GC_GLUE_TARGET` will be linked into `omrgc`, `OMR_UTIL_GLUE_TARGET` will be linked into `omrutil` and so on.

## Running tests

Ensure the tests are being built and that `OMR_FVTEST` is `On` (Note: default is off).

You must use the example glue. `OMR_GLUE` should be `example/glue`. `OMR_EXAMPLE` should be set to `ON`. Most tests will
not function without the example glue.

To actually run the tests:
```bash
# from the build directory
ctest -V
```

## Cross compiling OMR

**Cross compiling is untested.** You must define a custom toolchain file for you cross compilers. More information about
this is [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html). OMR relies on native build tools that
must be available on the build platform. In a cross compile, these tools are to be imported from a native build.

Cross compiling OMR is done in two steps:

1. build the tools targeting the native platform:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p native_build && cd native_build
   cmake .. && cmake --build .
   ```
   This will generate `tools/ImportTools.cmake`. To import the tools, point the variable `OMR_TOOLS_IMPORTFILE` at this
   file.

2. Cross compile using your CC toolchain and native tools:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p foreign_build && cd foreign_buid
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/file
   cmake .. -DOMR_TOOLS_IMPORTFILE=../native_build/tools/ImportTools.cmake
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Extra Feature Flags

*  OMR_SANITIZER={address,thread,undefined} turns on one: [Address Sanitizer
   (ASan)][asan], [Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer (UBSan)][ubsan] or [Thread
   Sanitizer (TSan)][tsan]. This only has an effect with GCC or Clang. 

[ubsan]: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html
[asan]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer
[tsan]: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html 

## What's next?

The work here is ongoing. We are tracking development with github issue
[#993](https://github.com/eclipse/omr/issues/933).
