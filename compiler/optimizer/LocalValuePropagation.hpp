/** \class LocalValuePropagation
 *
 *  \brief An optimization that propagates value constraints within a block.

 *  The local value propagation optimization can conduct constant, type
 *  and relational propagation within a block. It propagates constants
 *  and types based on assignments and performs removal of subsumed checks
 *  and compares. Also performs devirtualization of calls, checkcast and
 *  array store check elimination.  It does not do value numbering, instead
 *  works on the assumption that every expression has a unique value
 *  number (improved effectiveness if expressions having same value are
 *  commoned by a prior local common subexpression elimination pass).
 *
 * \note
 *  The class is not intented to be extended, ValuePropagation is the core
 *  engine and home to extension points of language specific optimizations
