/**
 * \internal Build the z/TPF ELF-format core dump from the JDB built by CCCPSE.

 * ends with a file suffix) we are to write the dump to, then ensure we
 * have enough room left over in the Java dump buffer left for us by
 * CCCPSE. If we do not, return an error. Otherwise, section the buffer
 * space off, building in order:
 *    - The ELF64 header
 *    - The ELF64 Program Header section
 *    - The ELF64 NOTE section
 *
 * Finally, write all the above to the indicated filename, and follow it
 * with a copy of storage contents from the Java dump buffer, which is
 * laid out in ascending address order, with the ELF64_Phdrs created to
 * match the dump buffer. Expect a final file size measured in tens
 * of megabytes.
 *
 * As a matter of protocol, set the first 8 bytes of the Java Dump
 * Buffer (struct ijavdbf) to zeros so CCCPSE knows it's okay to
 * write over its contents once we're done working with it.
 *
 * The arg block is used for the bi-directional passing of data. Those of its
 * members which are pointers (most of them, in fact) are used mainly for
 * output or at least have an output role. The fields of <arg> which are
 * required are shown as input parameters below. The fields of <arg> which
 * are used for output are detailed as return values.
 *
 * Since the pthread_create() calls limits us to one pointer to type void as the
 * function's input, and the function is required to return a void pointer, this
 * function will take the address of the <arg> block as the input parameter, and
 * will return a pointer to type char which represents the file name which now
 * contains the full path name of the ELF-format core dump file. There are also
 * fields in <arg> that will be updated as described below.
 *
 * \param[in][out]     arg   pointer to a user-created datatype 'args', declared

 *                                        to be at least PATH_MAX+1 in size.
 * \param[in]        arg->wkspcSize        32-bit quantity representing the size in
 *                                        bytes of the wkSpace field, following.
 * \param[in]        arg->wkSpace        64-bit pointer to scratch workspace for

 *
 * The Elf64_Phdr looks like this:<b><tt>
 * 0000 0004    p_type        Type of memory this Phdr represents.<b>
 * 0004 0004    p_flags        Phdr flags (permissions +OS_specific bits)<b>
 * 0008 0008    p_offset    Offset in file (0-relative) of memory image<b>
 * 0010 0008    p_vaddr        Virtual address of memory image @ run time<b>
 * 0018 0008    p_addr        Physical adress of memory image @ run time<b>
 * 0020 0008    p_filesz    Size of memory image in file<b>
 * 0028 0008    p_memsz        Size of memory image in memory<b>
 * 0030    0008    p_align        Boundary to align to when loaded<b>
 * ---- ----<b>
 * 0038 0038    Total length (56 decimal), natural alignment/size.<b></tt>
 *
 *    p_type should be obvious. Unlike relocatable/absolute ELF forms, the
 *    The 0th element does not have to be a PT_NULL. In fact, observed core
 *    files often are of type PT_NOTE; we'll follow that pattern. The 2nd
 *    through last elements are PT_LOAD.
 *
 *    p_flags are just the permissions. For PT_NULL, they're zero. For PT_NOTE,
 *    they're zero (not loaded to memory), and the PT_LOADs are rwx (7).
 *
 *    p_offset is the offset from zero in the file at which the image starts.
 *    Each file-resident image runs continuously & sequentially for p_filesz.
 *    We'll have to calculate the offset value and keep a running total, starting
 *    from p_offset for the PT_NOTE segment, then incrementing it by each
 *    p_filesz value.
 *
 *    p_vaddr is the virtual address at which the segment resides. It's truly
 *    meant more for executables & shared objects, its content of of little
 *    consequence; but we'll take a policy of making it the physical address.
 *    Same for p_addr, which is meant to describe the physical address. App-
 *    ropriate for a core file, not so much for a typical executable/DSO.
 *
 *    p_memsz is the image's size when loaded to memory. For a core file,
 *    p_filesz = p_memsz. This would make a difference for an executable or
 *    DSO (this is how the .bss segment, for example, is described: memsz as
 *    required, 0 filesz.
 *
 *    p_align is the required alignment, if any, for the memory image described
 *    by this phdr. A value of 0 or 1 means no alignment required. Otherwise,
 *    the value should be modulo of a page size. For a core file, just use 1.
 *
 *
 * \param[in]  buffer    Address of writeable memory large enough to house all
 *                        required Phdr elements (phnum * sizeof(Elf64_Phdr)).
 * \param[in]  dbfHdr    Address of the Java dump buffer given to us by CCCPSE
 * \param[in]  phnum    The number of program headers to write
 *
 * \returns
 *      Count of program headers written.
