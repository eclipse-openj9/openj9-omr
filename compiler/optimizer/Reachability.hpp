/* This is essentially a mini dataflow engine that can compute reachability in
 * linear time, in one pass over any CFG.  It does not have the full generality
 * of the real dataflow engine (which can't be done in linear time due to kill
 * sets), but can very quickly compute which blocks are reachable from a given
 * set of blocks.
 *
 * TO USE THIS INSTEAD OF THE DATAFLOW ENGINE
 * - You must be computing just one bit per block
 * - The dataflow problem must be "any-path"
 * - The dataflow problem must have no kill sets
 *
 * To add a new reachability analysis, derive your class from either
 * TR_ForwardReachability or TR_BackwardReachability, and implement the
 * isOrigin function.  Then, the perform function will populate a
 * bitvector with the set of blocks reachable from any block for which
 * isOrigin returned "true".
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 * The algorithm is DeRemer and Penello's so-called "digraph" algorithm which,
 * despite its odd name, can indeed handle cyclic graphs.
 *
 * See: "Efficient Computation of LALR(1) Look-Ahead Sets" p.625, DeRemer and Penello 1982.
 *
 * AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
 * - Compute a bitvector at each block, instead of a single boolean, so
 *   multiple reachability problems can be solved simultaneously in one pass.
 * - Change recursion into iteration to avoid stack overflow on large CFGs
 * - Perhaps separate propagateInputs from isOrigin into separate classes so
 *   they could be composed in arbitrary ways.
 * - Perhaps use templates to improve efficiency by using static dispatch
 *   instead of virtual functions.
