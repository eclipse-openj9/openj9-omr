/**
 * @brief used to represent virtual machine variables that are maintained in a structure stored in a local variable, such as a thread or frame object passed as a parameter to the method
 *
 * The value does not need to be a virtual machine register, but often it is the registers
 * of the virtual machine that are candidates for VirtualMachineRegisterInStruct. An
 * alternative is VirtualMachineRegister, which can be more convenient if the virtual
 * machine value is stored in a more arbitrary place or in a structure that isn't readily
 * accessible inside the compiled method. 
 * VirtualMachineRegisterInStruct is a subclass of VirtualMachineRegister
 *
 * The simulated register value is simply stored in a single local variable, which
 * gives the compiler visibility to all changes to the register (and enables
 * optimization / simplification). Because there is just a single local variable,
 * the Merge() function does not need to do anything (the value is accessible from
 * the same location at all locations). The Commit() and Reload() functions simply
 * move the value back and forth between the local variable and the structure that
 * holds the actual virtual machine state.
