/**
 * @brief provide mechanism to call arbitrary C functions by signature passing array of arguments
 *
 * ThunkBuilder provides a mechanism like libffi to be able to construct a call to any C function
 * by passing arguments in an array. It is not an uncommon scenario when writing a languge runtime
 * that you have to call a native function, but you cannot write a direct call to it. For example,
 * a language may provide the name of a native call target along with its signature and arguments,
 * but the runtime still needs to pass those arguments to particular native function. The runtime
 * code needs to be able to handle any kind of native call signature: any number of arguments and
 * any combination of parameter types and any return type. ThunkBuilder provides a convenient way
 * to generalize the calling of native functions assuming you can describe the signature and have
 * a function address to call.
 *
 * When creating a ThunkBuilder instance, you provide the set of parameters and the return type. After
 * compiling the ThunkBuilder instance, the resulting thunk can be used to call any function with that
 * signature. You pass the address of the function as well as a properly sized array of Word sized
 * arguments. The thunk will convert each argument to the type of its corresponding parameter as it
 * calls the given function, and will return the return value as expected.
