/*
 * Class TR_CatchBlockRemover
 * ==========================
 *
 * Catch block removal is a simple optimization that aims to do two things
 *
 * 1) Eliminate catch blocks that have no incoming exception edges, i.e. the 
 * optimizer has proven that no exception thrown from any of its exception 
 * predecessors (usually blocks generated for the try region) can reach a 
 * particular catch block.
 * 
 * 2) Eliminate exception edges that cannot be taken, e.g. if a particular 
 * block had all its exception points removed by the optimizer then it can 
 * no longer throw anything; so all the exception edges going out from the 
 * block can be deleted. It also eliminates an exception edge if the possible 
 * exceptions are still not ones that can be caught by a particular catch block.
 * 
 * These transformations simplify the flow of control in general and make it 
 * simpler for later analyses to work.
