/**
 * The scratch register manager addresses a peculiarity of internal control flow
 * regions: all virtual registers used inside internal control flow must appear in
 * postconditions on the end-of-control-flow label in order for the local register
 * assigner to behave properly. Before the scratch register manager, If you had
 * complex logic in your internal control flow, requiring many short-lived
 * virtual registers, you had only two choices:
 * 
 * A. Add all these registers to the end-of-control-flow label. This causes all
 *    the registers to be live at the same time, increasing register pressure and
 *    causing unnecessary spills. It also stops working as soon as you need more
 *    virtuals than you have real registers in the processor.
 * 
 * B. Re-use virtuals. This is a very awkward ad-hoc approach that had a terrible
 *    effect on the tree evaluator code. Often, the logic for a particular evaluator
 *    (like checkcast or write barriers) is split among several functions, so to
 *    reuse these temporary virtuals, they must be passed from one function to
 *    another as parameters. Some functions ended up with three or four such
 *    parameters with increasingly obscure names, and it became hard to tell
 *    when register reuse decisions were for correctness or for efficiency.
 * 
 * Neither of these choices is very appealing. B has the potential for generating
 * good code, but the functions that implement B quickly become very hard to
 * maintain.
 * 
 * What the scratch register manager (SRM) does is to keep track of which virtuals
 * are available for reuse. The steps look like this:
 * 
 * 1. The code that creates an internal control flow region also creates an SRM The
 * 2. SRM is passed around to all the tree evaluator code implementing the internal
 *    control flow.
 * 3. Any code that wants a temporary register requests one from the SRM
 * 4. When the temporary register is no longer needed, it is returned to the SRM
 * 5. At the end, SRM is asked to add all its managed registers as
 *    postconditions to a given regdeps object.
 * 6. The end-of-control-flow label is created using those regdeps
 *
 * The effect is that you get the benefits of an optimally-implemented version of
 * B but with maintainability on par with ordinary virtual register allocation
 * outside an internal control flow region (where you’d just use allocateRegister
 * and stopUsingRegister).
