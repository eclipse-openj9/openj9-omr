/**
 * @brief simulates an operand stack used by many bytecode based virtual machines
 * In such virtual machines, the operand stack holds the intermediate expression values
 * computed by the bytecodes. The compiler simulates this operand stack as well, but
 * what is pushed to and popped from the simulated operand stack are expression nodes
 * that represent the value computed by the bytecodes. As each bytecode pops expression
 * nodes off the operand stack, it combines them to form more complicated expressions
 * which are then pushed back onto the operand stack for consumption by other bytecodes.
 *
 * The stack is represented as an array of pointers to TR::IlValue's, making it
 * easy to use IlBuilder services to consume and compute new values. Note that,
 * unlike VirtualMachineRegister, the simulated operand stack is *not* maintained
 * by the method code as part of the method's stack frame. This approach requires
 * modelling the state of the operand stack at all program points, which means
 * there cannot only be one VirtualMachineOperandStack object.
 *
 * The current implementation does not share anything among different
 * VirtualMachineOperandStack objects. Possibly, some of the state could be
 * shared to save some memory. For now, simplicity is the goal.
 *
 * VirtualMachineOperandStack implements VirtualMachineState:
 * Commit() simply iterates over the simulated operand stack and stores each
 *   value onto the virtual machine's operand stack (more details at definition).
 * Reload() is left empty; assumption is that each BytecodeBuilder handler will
 *   update the state of the operand stack appropriately on return from the
 *   interpreter.
 * MakeCopy() copies the state of the operand stack
 * MergeInto() is slightly subtle. Operations may have been already created
 *   below the merge point, and those operations will have assumed the
 *   expressions are stored in the TR::IlValue's for the state being merged
 *   *to*. So the purpose of MergeInto() is to store the values of the current
 *   state into the same variables as in the "other" state.
 * 
 * VirtualMachineOperandStack provides several stack-y operations:
 *   Push() pushes a TR::IlValue onto the stack
 *   Pop() pops and returns a TR::IlValue from the stack
 *   Top() returns the TR::IlValue at the top of the stack
 *   Pick() returns the TR::IlValue "depth" elements from the top
 *   Drop() discards "depth" elements from the stack
 *   Dup() is a convenience function for Push(Top())
 *
