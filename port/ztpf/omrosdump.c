 *        executing a hook (such as -Xdump:system:events=vmstop) and arrange for one to be
 *        created right now. If a dump pertinent to us is available, we use it. We then call
 *        ztpfBuildCoreDump() in order to build an ELF core dump from its contents, then
 *        write it to file.
 *
 *        After we're done writing the file, zeroize the Java Dump Buffer pointer in the
 *        DIB block.
 *
 * \param[in] portLibrary       The port library.
 * \param[in,out] filename      Buffer for filename. On input, describes a requested filename.
 * \param[in] dumpType          Type of dump to perform. Ignored for z/TPF.
 * \param[in] userData          Implementation specific data. Ignored for z/TPF.
 * \return 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
 *
 * \note <TT>filename</TT> buffer can not be NULL.
 * \note User must allocate and free <TT>filename</TT> buffer.
 * \note <TT>filename</TT> buffer length is platform dependent, assumed to be <TT>EsMaxPath</TT> or <TT>MAX_PATH</TT>
 * \note If <TT>filename</TT> buffer is empty, an error will be returned. Should it
 *        contain only a filename (no path), one will be chosen for it.

	 * First, figure out whether or not we have to generate the dump buffer contents.
	 * If this routine was called as a result of a hooked event being hit; not a
	 * program check, then there is not a Java dump buffer (JDB) provided by the
	 * z/TPF Control Program (supervisor, kernel, whatever you want to call the
	 * permanently-memory-resident part of the system loaded by IPL).
	 *
	 * If we knew that this thread were the same thread which faulted, we could simply
	 * check ce2dib->dibjdb for non-zero content. Unfortunately, we don't have that
	 * assurance. Instead, the ce2dib address was stored by the synchronous master
	 * signal callback routine in the process block. Fetch it and see if it's non-zero.
	 * If so, a thread (the system dump agent) was dispatched here to create the dump
	 * file due to a synchronous signal (like SIGSEGV). If not, there was no signal
	 * and thus no existing data from which to write the core file.
	 *
	 * If there was no signal involved, we know that this call to omrdump_create()
	 * was issued by the system dump agent which fired because of a hooked event. In
	 * these cases, we presume that the user has a reason for wanting to see a system
	 * snapshot at the event, and we have to issue a SERRC 4006 in order to get the
	 * dump buffer created, even if it is quite a few microseconds after the call to
	 * the dump agents from the Dump() java class or a hooked event. We'll have to do
	 * this -- it's as close in time as we can get. Once the 4006 comes back, we can
	 * dispatch a thread to write the dump core file and wait on it. From that point, we
	 * will follow a very simple common process regardless of how the "OS core dump" file
	 * was created: we will rename it to whatever the system dump agent specified in the
	 * call and then we're done.
	 *
	 * It is crucial that the "OS core file" be written to the same path as the dump
	 * agent specified for the final filename. When we rename it, we will invoke no
	 * I/O overhead -- rename() simply alters the name field in the directory entry.
	 *
	 * A MFS (memory file system) output destination is recommended for speed's sake.
