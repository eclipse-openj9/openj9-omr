    * After all such nodes have been marked, the safe parts of the tree are
    * anchored and usafe parts vandalized via a call to
    * \ref UnsafeSubexpressionRemover::eliminateStore.

    * transformation arose beneath a \TR::Node representing a store operation -
    * hence the name of the \c eliminateStore method.  That method will need to
