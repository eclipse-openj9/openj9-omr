 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_CONTROL (3) -- control registers
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_FPR (4) -- floating point registers
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_MODULE (5) -- module information
 * @param[in] index the index of the item in the specified category. Use @ref omrsig_info_count to determine how many indices in each category
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL_TYPE -- when category = OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL, returns the signal type. Always defined.
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL_HANDLER -- when category = OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL, returns the address of the handler. Always defined.
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL_ADDRESS -- when category = OMRPORT_SIG_SIGNAL, returns the address where the fault occurred, if available
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_CONTROL_PC -- when category = OMRPORT_SIG_CONTROL, returns the PC value when the fault occurred, if available

 * @param[out] name the name of the item at the specified index.
 * @param[out] value the value of the item at the specified index
 *
 * @return the kind of info at the specified index. For example, this allows the caller to determine whether the item placed in **value corresponds to a 32/64-bit integer or a pointer to a string.
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_VALUE_UNDEFINED -- value is unknown
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_VALUE_STRING -- value is a (const char*) and points to a NUL terminated string

 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_VALUE_64 -- value is a (uint64_t*) and points to an integer value
 * \arg OMRPORT_SIG_VALUE_FLOAT_64 -- value is a (double*) and points to a floating point value. No assumptions should be made about the validity of the floating point number.

/**
 * Synchronous signals (i.e. those caused by program execution) must be handled via structured exception handling (omrsig_protect).
 * Asynchronous signals, such as SIGQUIT, are not suitable for structured exception handling, since they don't represent an error condition, but instead
 * indicate that some external event has occurred. They are not associated with a specific thread or with a  section of code.
 *
 * When an asynchronous signal arrives, a new thread is created and the handler function is invoked on that thread.
 * If multiple handlers are registered, they will all be invoked on the same thread in an arbitrary order.
 *
 * If asynchronous signals are currently being reported this function will block until all threads reporting an asynchronous signal
 * have completed. This has two consequences. Firstly, omrsig_set_async_signal_handler is a blocking operation. Do not call it
 * while you hold a synchronization resource which might be required by a handler. Secondly, you may safely assume that your
 * signal handler will never be invoked again once you have removed it. There is no possibility that the handler is currently running,
 * or that it is just about to run. Once a handler is removed (by using flags=0) any resources it relies on may safely be freed.
 *
 * @param[in] portLibrary The port library
 * @param[in] handler the function to call if an async signal arrives
 * @param[in] handler_arg the argument to handler
 * @param[in] flags used to indicate which asynchronous signals are handled:
 * 	OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGQUIT - (triggered when program state should be dumped - Ctrl+/ on Unix, Ctrl+Break on Windows)
 * 	OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGABRT - (triggered when the the program should terminate and produce a core file)
 * 	OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGTERM - (triggered when the program should terminate gracefully - Ctrl+C on Unix and Windows)
 * OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGRECONFIG - (triggered when DLPAR information has changed and the program should dynamically reconfigure itself)
 * OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGXFSZ - (triggered when program exceeds the allowed ulimit file size)
 * OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGALLASYNC - any of the above asynchronous signals
 *
 * @note If a handler with the specified function pointer and argument is already registered, calling this function again will change its flags.
 * @note To remove a handler, use 0 for the flags argument.
 *
 * @note A handler should not rely on the handling thread being an attached omrthread. It may be a raw operating system thread.
 * @note A handler should not do anything to cause the reporting thread to terminate (e.g. call omrthread_exit()) as that may prevent
 *  future signals from being reported.

 * A new element is added to the asyncHandlerList for omrsig_handler_fn, and masterASynchSignalHandler is registered
 * with the OS for the signal corresponding to the specified portlibSignalFlag. masterASynchSignalHandler invokes
 * asyncHandlerList elements when a relevant signal is raised. If portlibSignalFlag is 0, then the asyncHandlerList
 * entry corresponding to omrsig_handler_fn is removed, and related resources are freed. portlibSignalFlag can only
 * have one signal flag set; otherwise, OMRPORT_SIG_ERROR is returned. One omrsig_handler_fn handler is registered
 * with a signal at any time instead of multiple handlers. When associating a new omrsig_handler_fn with a signal,
 * prior omrsig_handler_fn(s) are dissociated from the signal. This function supports all signals listed in
 * OMRPORT_SIG_FLAG_SIGALLASYNC.
 *
 * The address of the old signal handler function is stored in *oldOSHandler. In case of error or if NULL is provided
 * for oldOSHandler, then *oldOSHandler is not updated to reflect the old signal handler function.

 * @brief Register a handler with the OS. For an invalid portlibSignalFlag, an error is returned.
 * portlibSignalFlag is invalid: if it is zero or if multiple signal bits are specified or if the
 * specified flag is not supported. If OS fails to register newOSHandler for the specified signal,
 * then an error is returned.
 *
 * The address of the old signal handler function is stored in *oldOSHandler. In case of error or
 * if NULL is provided for oldOSHandler, then *oldOSHandler is not updated to reflect the old
 * signal handler function.
 *
 * This function may override a master handler which was previously set by omrsig_protect or
 * omrsig_set_*_async_signal_handler variant. The records associated with the master handler
 * for the portlibSignalFlag signal are left unchanged when this function overrides the master
 * handler. When the master handler is re-registered with the portlibSignalFlag signal, then
 * the records associated with master handler don't need to be restored. An example of records
 * is OMR*AsyncHandlerRecord(s) in asyncHandlerList.
 *
 * Each platform variant of omrsignal.c should have a signalMap. signalMap should have a list of
 * signals, which are supported on a platform. This function supports all signals listed in
 * omrsignal.c::signalMap.
 *
 * On Unix variants, sigaction is used to register the handler. SA_SIGINFO flag is set.
 * So, the signature of the signal handling function should be void (*)(int, siginfo_t *, void *).
 * On zLinux, the signature changes to void (*)(int, siginfo_t *, void *, uintptr_t).
 *
 * sigaction isn't available on Windows. On Windows, signal is used to register the handler.
 * The signature of the signal handling function should be void (*)(int).
 *
 * On Unix variants, original OS handler is cached in oldActions while registering the first handler
 * with the OS. The original OS handler is restored during shutdown. If OMRSIG_SIGACTION is called outside
 * OMR, then the original OS handler can get overwritten without being cached in oldActions. Subsequently,
 * the oldActions can cache a user handler instead of the original OS handler. During shutdown, the
 * original OS handler can be restored incorrectly. omrsig_register_os_handler lets a user register a
 * handler with the OS while properly caching the original OS handler. The original OS handler is properly
 * restored during shutdown.
