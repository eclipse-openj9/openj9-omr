/*
 * Class TR_LocalReordering
 * ========================
 * 
 * Local reordering is an optimization that aims to reduce the (register) live 
 * ranges of RHS values of stores in two ways:
 * 
 * 1) By "delaying" a store closer to its use (if that use is in the same block) 
 * so that the RHS value will be live across a smaller range of IL trees once 
 * local copy propagation happens and the use is replaced by a commoned 
 * reference to the RHS value.
 * 
 * 2) By "moving earlier" a store whose RHS is anchored (i.e. evaluated) 
 * earlier in the block before the store. In this case, by moving the store 
 * earlier, the live range of the RHS value may be reduced (if there was 
 * no later use of the RHS value).
 *
 * This optimization's thrust is (register) live range reduction and 
 * it runs on IL trees in the common code optimizer. A more general 
 * "local live range reduction" (that is the name of the pass) optimization
 * was implemented later and it aims to reduce live ranges in even more 
 * cases (including some cases independent of stores). However local reordering 
 * was not disabled even after local live range reduction was enabled.
