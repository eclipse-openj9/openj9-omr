/** \brief
 *     Examines how often a load is being used to feed into a signed vs. unsigned conversion (ex. i2l vs iu2l) and
 *     attempts to skip the conversion by sign/zero extending the load at the point it is evaluated (where the source 
 *     value is actually loaded). This codegen optimization relies on the assumption that the target codegen supports 
 *     load and sign/zero extend instructions and that emitting such an instruction is no more expensive than an 
 *     ordinary load.
 *
 *  \details
 *     This codegen phase pass consists of two steps; the find and the flag preferred load extensions steps.
 *
 *     1. Find preferred load extensions
 *
 *        We iterate through every node in the current compilation unit looking for conversion operations with loads
 *        as the operand. For example a conversion from int to long of a field load o.f:
 *
 *        \code
 *        i2l
 *          iloadi <f>
 *            aload <o>
 *        \endcode
 *
 *        For each such conversion, depending on the type, i.e. sign/zero extension, we record how often each unique
 *        load feeds into such a conversion. In the above snippet the conversion is a sign extension so we would bias
 *        the load towards sign extensions. If the same load were to appear underneath an iu2l conversion we would bias
 *        the load towards zero extensions.
 *
 *        When all trees in the compilation unit have been processed for each load we know exactly how many times it
 *        appears underneath a signed vs. unsigned conversion.
 *
 *     2. Flag preferred load extensions
 *
 *        Since we know the preference of sign vs. zero extension for each load we can now traverse the compilation
 *        unit again and based on the preference of a load we can mark it with the signExtendTo[32|64]BitAtSource or 
 *        zeroExtendTo[32|64]BitAtSource flags to force the extension to happen right at the source. Since we have an
 *        implicit assumption that such extensions are effectively free we can now skip the evaluation of all 
 *        conversions of the respective extensions.
 *
 *        For example in the above code snippet if the load was found to prefer sign extensions we can mark the load
 *        with the signExtendTo64BitAtSource flag and subsequently the i2l conversion can be skipped by marking it with
 *        the unneededConv flag. The final trees will look like this:
 *
 *        \code
 *        i2l (unneededConv)
 *          iloadi <f> (signExtendTo64BitAtSource)
 *            aload <o>
 *        \endcode
 *
 *        Note that if the same load were to appear underneath an iu2l conversion, this conversion cannot be skipped
 *        because of the extension preference of the load.
 *
 *     All load evaluators must respect the signExtendTo[32|64]BitAtSource and zeroExtendTo[32|64]BitAtSource flags.
 *
 *  \section Debug Counters
 *     You can track the locations of where this optimization succeeded via the following debug counter:
 *
 *     \code
 *     -Xjit:staticDebugCounters={codegen/LoadExtensions/success/unneededConversion*}
 *     \endcode
 *
 *  \section Node Flags
 *     This optimization sets the following node flags:
 *        - unneededConv
 *        - signExtendTo32BitAtSource
 *        - signExtendTo64BitAtSource
 *        - zeroExtendTo32BitAtSource
 *        - zeroExtendTo64BitAtSource
