/*
 * Class TR_SimplifyAnds
 * =====================
 *
 * And simplification is an optimization that is aimed at simplifying the 
 * control flow created primarily by the loop versioning optimization 
 * (block versioning emits similar trees as well though it usually 
 * does transformations in far fewer cases than loop versioning). It is 
 * also possible that other optimizations or indeed the original user 
 * program results in similar opportunities but its most common coming 
 * from loop versioning. Here is an example loop:
 * 
 * i=0;
 * while (i < N)
 *    {
 *    a[i] = a[i] + b[i];
 *    i++;
 *    }
 * 
 * This loop has 3 null checks and 3 bound checks in Java, one for each of 
 * the 3 array accesses. Each of these checks gets considered in isolation 
 * by the loop versioner and the following tests are done outside the loop 
 * to decide if the fast loop (without any null check or bound check) or 
 * the slow loop (with all the checks) should be executed.
 * 
 * if (a == null)     goto blockA; // test emitted for the null check on the read of a[i]
 * if (a.length <= N) goto blockA; // test emitted for the bound check on the read of a[i]
 * if (i < 0)         goto blockA; // second test emitted for the bound check on the read of a[i]
 * if (b == null)     goto blockA; // test emitted for the null check on the read of b[i]
 * if (b.length <= N) goto blockA; // test emitted for the bound check on the read of b[i]
 * if (i < 0)         goto blockA; // second test emitted for the bound check on the read of b[i]
 * if (a == null)     goto blockA; // test emitted for the null check on the write of a[i]
 * if (a.length <= N) goto blockA; // test emitted for the bound check on the write of a[i]
 * if (i < 0)         goto blockA; // second test emitted for the bound check on the write of a[i]
 * 
 * There are obviously some redundant tests emitted here by the loop versioner 
 * but that optimization simply relies on later cleanup passes to eliminate those 
 * redundant tests. This is where and simplification comes in. The above control flow 
 * construct is similar to a "logical and" of all those conditions and this is 
 * where the name of the optimization comes from.
 * 
 * And simplification runs after basic block extension has been done and a long 
 * extended block created containing the above cascade of tests and local CSE has 
 * commoned up expressions within that extended block. This means that there 
 * are several pairs of "obvious" semantically equivalent trees in the above 
 * extended block, namely, nodes with the same IL opcode and the same children. 
 * This is the exact pattern that and simplification looks for and optimizes in 
 * a manner such that a given test (opcode) will only be done once in an 
 * extended block with the exact same children. e.g. in the above example we 
 * will not test if (a == null) more than once and ditto for if (i < 0). Note 
 * it may be possible for other optimizations to do this cleanup, in particular 
 * value propagation knows about relations between expressions but and 
 * simplification is a very simple cheap pass compared to value propagation 
 * and can be run more times if deemed appropriate.
 * 
 * There was also another unrelated transformation that was subsequently 
 * added to and simplification to optimize:
 * 
 * t = rhs1;
 * if (cond)
 *   t = t + rhs2;
 * 
 * to:
 * 
 * t = rhs1;
 * t = t + (rhs2 & ~(cond-1));
 * 
 * which is a branch free but equivalent code sequence that was beneficial 
 * on one of the important Java benchmarks. This minor control flow simplifying 
 * transformation could be separated into a different pass strictly speaking 
 * but is done as part of the pass as it stands.

/*
 * Class TR_Rematerialization
 * ==========================
 *
 * Rematerialization is an optimization that aims to avoid register spills by 
 * un-commoning certain nodes that would be cheaper to simply re-evaluate. A 
 * simple example is if we have a load of a parm commoned across a range of 
 * code that has very high register pressure. The commoned load obviously 
 * adds to register pressure and could be the trigger for spills occurring 
 * across the area of high register pressure if the local register allocator 
 * simply cannot fit in all the values into available registers.
 * 
 * Rematerialization keeps track of the number of commoned expressions at 
 * every point as it walks over the IL trees and if it sees that the number 
 * of commoned expressions is more than the available registers on that platform, 
 * it un-commons one of the expressions if possible (after making sure this 
 * will not change the program's behaviour). This would cause the expression to 
 * be evaluated again (i.e. the expression must be "rematerialized") and in the 
 * case of our load of an auto this should be cheaper than spilling to a stack 
 * slot and reloading from that slot. Some cheap arithmetic operations are also 
 * considered cheap enough to re-evaluate instead of spilling, e.g. iadd.
 * 
 * Finally there are some expressions that can be un-commoned regardless of 
 * register pressure. One example is some addressing expressions that can be 
 * folded into a memory reference on some platforms depending on the addressing 
 * modes that are available. e.g. a shift and add can be folded into the memory 
 * reference on X86...so we do not need to common those operations under 
 * aiadd/aladd on that platform since it need never be evaluated into a register 
 * if we did not common the aiadd/aladd or any of its children.
 * 
 * One question might be: Why do we have rematerialization un-common when we 
 * could have simply taught local CSE to avoid commoning in the first place? 
 * This goes back to the insight that commoning of nodes has more than just 
 * the benefit of keeping the value in a register; a commoned node also helps 
 * simplify some node pattern matching in places like simplifier. Such places 
 * do not need to check for two different nodes being the same semantically, 
 * they can just check for the same node on the assumption that if they were 
 * semantically equivalent then local CSE would have commoned them up anyway. 
 * Thus we rarely stop local CSE from commoning (though there are occasional 
 * cases in which this is the best option); we usually want to let it do its 
 * job and we also let downstream optimizations benefit from that commoning 
 * in the above manner. Rematerialization runs late enough in the optimization 
 * strategy that it no longer matters as much if un-commoning happens at 
 * that point; there are not very many pattern matching optimizations 
 * to follow anyway.
 * 
 * Generalizing this point, one should keep an open mind about creating an 
 * optimization pass to "undo" what an earlier optimization pass did 
 * rather than simply limit the earlier optimization to not do something; 
 * this is especially relevant when the "opportunity for undoing" could 
 * have arisen not just from an earlier optimization pass but also from 
 * the user having written their code in a particular suboptimal manner.
