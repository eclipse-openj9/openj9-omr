 * Creates an iterator for the native threads present within the process, either all native threads

 * This function will suspend all of the native threads that will be presented through the iterator
 * and they will remain suspended until this function or nextDo return NULL. The context for the
 * calling thread is always presented first.
 *
 * @param heap used to contain the thread context, the stack frame representations and symbol strings. No
 * 			memory is allocated outside of the heap provided. Must not be NULL.
 * @param state semi-opaque structure used as a cursor for iteration. Must not be NULL User visible fields
 *			are:
 * 			deadline - the system time in seconds at which to abort introspection and resume
 * 			error - numeric error description, 0 on success
 * 			error_detail - detail for the specific error
 * 			error_string - string description of error
 * @param signal_info a signal context to use. This will be used in place of the live context for the
 * 			calling thread.
 *
 * @return NULL if there is a problem suspending threads, gathering thread contexts or if the heap
 * is too small to contain even the context without stack trace. Errors are reported in the error,
 * and error_detail fields of the state structure. A brief textual description is in error_string.
