 * @ingroup Port
 * @brief Signal handling details exclusive to z/TPF.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 *
 * \details z/TPF does not have <i>reliable signals</i>, also known as <i>kernel-space</i> 
 * signals in certain circles. Instead, all signals processing takes place in user space. Normally, the 
 * act of delivering a signal (via <tt>kill()</tt>, <tt>pthread_kill()</tt>, <tt>raise()</tt>, et al) takes 
 * place in user-space with no supervisory intervention; and once it's delivered, the process (or thread) must
 * <i>declare itself ready to accept signals</i> via either a <tt>tpf_process_signals()</tt> or 
 * <tt>tpf_thread_process_signals()</tt> call. That's going to sound weird to a modern UNIX 
 * programmer, but that's the way it is, and it actually <i>works</i> for certain kinds
 * of programs. Unfortunately, those programs which expect to be rerouted to a signal handler
 * without warning (or consciously <i>"being ready" to process a signal</i>) aren't 
 * among that set of code. In other words, there are no such things as 'synchronous signals'
 * in z/TPF: all units of work (UOW) must declare themselves ready and willing to process any
 * signals which may have been delivered to them since the last such declaration through the
 * issuance of a <tt>tpf_process_signals()</tt> call.
 *
 * UNIX, on which most of this segment was originally founded, _does_ have reliable
 * signals whereas z/TPF has none. Reliable signals is a way of saying that when a signal is 
 * delivered and is NOT masked out, control is immediately transferred to the signal handler 
 * registered for that particular signal -- it spends no time in a 'signal pending' state. 
 * The way UNIX scheduling works, a <i>"context switch"</i> is performed when one 
 * scheduleable unit of work (hereafter, UOW) has the CPU taken from it and assigned to the 
 * next scheduleable UOW. To put it another way, the scheduler will change the now active UOW's <i>context</i>
 * from "active, running" to "dormant, awaiting rescheduling" (or whichever event it's awaiting, which 
 * could be an I/O completion, for example). 
 *
 * The dirty work of taking a CPU core away from a UOW is accomplished by stopping
 * the current CPU, taking a copy of the machine state into what's called the <b><i>"machine
 * state context"</i></b> (<tt>struct uc_mcontext</tt>) consisting of the PSW, registers, 
 * etc, then setting its <b>"link state"</b> context (<tt>struct uc_link</tt>) to the next 
 * executable instruction the outgoing UOW would have executed, putting this UOW at the 
 * end of the queue; then selecting the next runnable UOW, restoring <i>its</i> <tt>uc_link</tt>
 * data members to the proper places as dictated by hardware, then causing execution to resume at 
 * the place <tt>uc_link</tt> says it should until the next timeslice expires. <i>Ad infinitum</i>.
 *
 * One of the descriptive statistics of how hard a UNIX-like machine is working is
 * the <i>"context switch per second"</i> rate. A large *NIX server executes approximately
 * twice as many context switches as it does interrupts over any small slice of time; some run 
 * with over 10,000 (and more) context switches per second.
 *
 * z/TPF schedules very differently. For a timesliced process, which all JVM
 * threads belong to, interrupts happen many, many times a second, and at each interrupt,
 * the scheduler decides if the UOW has had its timeslice expire (or for more traditional TPF
 * processes, which perform the equivalent of a <tt>yield()</tt> instruction for SCHED_FIFO
 * scheduling, which is the original scheduling paradigm of the z/TPF system. If so, the machine
 * state is stored in pages 2 and 3 of the Entry Control Block, and its scheduleable
 * UOW address (the <i>Entry Control Block</i> or <b>ECB</b>) is queued on one of at least five 
 * "CPU lists", depending on what its next expected state is. This data placement is the z/TPF
 * equivalent of a UNIX context switch. But <b>the current machine state has nothing to do with 
 * signal deliveries</b>, and that's what this segment is about: <i>the context switch that would have taken place if z/TPF supported 
 * the delivery of reliable signals to the signal handler</i>.
 *
 * What we <em>do</em> have is the full machine state <b>when any dump is taken.</b> Whether
 * the dump is the result of what we've been calling a "non-preemptible" event 
 * (i.e. a <i>program check</i>, meaning that the process is going to exit shortly) 
 * or a "hooked" event (meaning that the Java user
 * has called for a dump on some otherwise normal event taking place, such as a 
 * JVM start or stop, or perhaps a 'soft' Java exception having been thrown, where
 * function <TT>j9dump_create()</TT> has to call for a dump from the z/TPF Control 
 * Program), we still have the <b>extremely recent</b> machine state captured for
 * us by the z/TPF SERRC processor, CCCPSE. Therefore, we <i>can</i> create a 'fake'
 * ucontext structure <b>as long as the data the structure is to contain comes from
 * a recent dump</b>. 
 *
 * In this segment, we labor under the presumption that the required dump has indeed been anticipated
 * by the "kernel's" (we call the supervisor the "z/TPF Control Program") program check interrupt routine.
 * If such a dump has been anticipated and the faulting UOW belongs to a process which is known to have 
 * been bound to a JVM, CCCPSE (the Control Program's program check handler) has created what's called 
 * a "Dump Interchange Record", out of which, in turn, is anchored a "Java Dump Buffer", or JDB.
 *
 * CCCPSE determines that eligible program checks fall into one of two categories. The first 
 * category is called a "preemptible error", one which the Java language has specified as a 
 * divide-by-zero or null-pointer exception (DBZ or NPE, respectively). In these situations,
 * the Java interpreter routine receiving the signal is supposed to know what to do with it, 
 * namely issue the 'soft' Java ArithmeticException("Divide-by-zero") or NullPointerException,
 * depending upon the exact type of interrupt taken. The TPF-ish data is translated into its
 * corresponding UNIX-information, such as "context blocks" required for each of these two
 * situations. In these cases, no JDB is anchored in the DIB, as no system dump agent activity
 * will take place.
 *
 * The second category is called a "non-preemptible error", one which CCCPSE cannot classify as
 * preemptible and is associated with a Java program under interpretation or a byte interpreter
 * malfunction. These kinds of program checks indicate something seriously wrong, such as a programming
 * or data error, and infers that the JVM may not be in a condition to continue. In this kind of case,
 * a JDB is anchored off the DIB in anticipation of the system dump agent being required to write
 * an ELF core dump file.
 *
 * The JDB contains in-memory copies of all the native stack frames, an Error Information
 * Record, and has made in-memory copies of every heap (malloc()'d heap nodes) in use by
 * the faulting address space. We write our own ELF core dump file from this information 
 * since the z/TPF kernel does not have this task as one of its duties like a UNIX kernel
 * would.
 *
 * Regardless of the kind of error CCCPSE has determined we have, we always have a DIB, which 
 * contains enough information to create the required context blocks associated with a 
 * synchronous signal. If the error is not preemptible, we have also spawned a thread to write
 * the ELF core dump file, in anticipation that it will be required by the system dump agent's
 * execution, to follow.
